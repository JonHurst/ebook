    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <h2>"This subheading has quotes"</h2>

    <p>"This is a fairly standard paragraph," said somebody, "and it has 'single quotes' for
    emphasis!"</p>

    <p>This paragraph has 'em and 'im, which are dialect. Here's 'em again.</p>

    <p>And here's 'im again.</p>

    <p>"'Single paragraphs,' was what he said here, without closing.</p>

    <p>"And here's the closing."</p>

    <p>This paragraph has "<i>italics 'here' and <b>bold italics 'here'</b></i> which may cause
    trouble."</p>

    <p>This paragraph has" malformed" quotes.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>"This is like a letter.</p>

      <p>"The opening quotes are not closed.</p>

      <p>"Until the end."</p>
    </div>

    <p>Test for--dashes--that are either---- PG style or—mdashes——.</p>

    <p>Test for ... various . . . types of ellipse.... And this . . . .</p>

    <p>Things often get odd—"with a mixture"—of—some "—dashes and quotes——"</p>
